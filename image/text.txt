Thank you for considering my proposal for adding iOS and Android    
authentication to your .NET Maui app. | have extensive experience   
in mobile app development and have worked on similar projects in    
the past.

To add face login and iOS accounts to your app, | propose using     
the following technologies:

For face login, | suggest using Apple's Face ID API for iOS and     
Google's Face Detection API for Android. These APIs provide
secure and reliable face recognition capabilities that can be easily
integrated into your app.

For iOS accounts, | suggest using Apple's Sign in with Apple API,
which allows users to sign in to your app using their Apple ID. This
provides a seamless and secure authentication experience for iOS
users.

| estimate that the project will take approximately [X] weeks to
complete, depending on the complexity of your app and the
specific requirements for authentication. My hourly rate is [X], and
lam open to negotiating a fixed price for the project.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. | look
forward to working with you on this project.
